## About the Project

The objective of this project was to develop a small theoretical analysis on the frequency of prices and subscribers in Udemy samples by dividing the courses in two groups based on whether they were low or high-priced, with differential value in regards to the median value of the total prices of the courses. 


### Libraries needed 

The libraries included are built-in Python:

* seaborn
* matplotlib.pyplot
* numpy
* pandas


## Results 

The results found from the analysis showcase that there is no significant influence of the prices on the number of subscribers of a Udemy course, considering that high-priced courses still had more subscribers than low-priced courses, different from the initial hypotheis.
